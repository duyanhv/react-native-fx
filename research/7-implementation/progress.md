# Implementation progress

The durable record of build execution. The **table** is the global view — one row per task,
current **state** only. **Detail blocks** below carry the full lifecycle checklist and proof
for active or complex tasks. The rules (lifecycle, states, proof, the closure rule) live in
[`subtask-protocol.md`](./subtask-protocol.md).

> **The cardinal rule:** a task is `complete` only when every `Closes:` ledger row is true in
> its **owning source doc** — not here, not in `data-layer.md`, not in the commit.

> **V1-cut readiness** lives in [`v1-cut-checklist.md`](./v1-cut-checklist.md) — the standing
> record of dispositions, the one remaining device gate (U3-007, waived), waivers, and known
> V1 limitations.

## Legend

- **state** (one per task): `todo · in-progress · blocked · headless-done · device-pending · docs-pending · ready-to-merge · merged`. `ready-to-merge` = **complete** (all gates through `docs-closed`; finishing commit not yet in); `merged` = complete **and** the finishing commit is in (on `integration/0.1.x`).
- **type:** `implement` (code) · `ratify` (decide in source doc) · `device-verify` (device proof) · `rework` (fix inconsistency) · `doc-cleanup` (source alignment).
- **device:** `yes` = has a non-headless gate (effects/animation/touch — will not run headless).
- **consumes / closes:** decision-ledger ids this task reads / must close.

## Tasks

Every in-flight ledger row is closed by exactly one task below. Resolved rows and the resolved
baseline are not tracked. Order is build order; deferred (V2 / trigger-gated) work is parked at
the bottom. A row needs a detail block only when it is active or has more than a one-line proof.

FX-007 closed.** **DEVICE GATE PASS — all 6 rows, both platforms (iPhone 17 Pro sim / iOS 26.5 + POCO F1 / API 35, 2026-06-14).** app-pulse compiles+renders animated/intensity-reactive; app-broken → onFxError no crash; cache no-recompile confirmed (iOS process-wide pipeline cache; Android per-view RuntimeShader); app-ios-only renders iOS / silent {via:'none'} Android; iOS lowers through FxSurfaceView (expo-view) per the spike; curated unregressed. Evidence in `evidence/device.md`. **RECOVERY (planner, 2026-06-14):** the device-gate agent accidentally `git checkout`-reverted the uncommitted DEF-008 work in `FxSurfaceView.swift` + `FxSurfaceShaderView.kt` while undoing instrumentation; git could not recover (never staged). Restored **verbatim from the review diffs** (diffstat re-matched 79/61 exactly) — gates re-green incl. iOS `xcodebuild` + Android `compileDebugKotlin`. **REVIEW REFINEMENT (planner, 2026-06-14, maintainer-flagged):** renamed `pipeline→curatedPipeline`, `resolvedPipeline→pipeline` (the name was hiding a runtime-compile side effect) + added a native curated-id stop (an iOS `curatedShaderIds` mirror, matching Android) so "curated ids win" is native-enforced, not JS-dependent — *behavior-preserving* (a curated id with a registered source is JS-impossible). Re-gated: tsc/lint/swift:lint/72 tests + iOS xcodebuild BUILD SUCCEEDED. **Next: docs-closed (FX-007 in `22` + ledger; cache-divergence note) then merge.** **Headless review PASS (planner, 2026-06-14).** Gates re-run independently (tsc/lint/swift:lint/72 tests); surface contract fully implemented + tested (8 registry tests); spike accepted as headless-definitive; rules #1/#2/#5/#7 gated; comments provenance-clean; the generalized `scanUniforms` (guards time/resolution/intensity) is a correct API-33-abort defense. **For docs-closed (planner):** the "cache by source" contract is iOS-satisfied (immutable `MTLRenderPipelineState`, process-wide); on Android a compiled `RuntimeShader` is *mutable* (holds per-view uniform state) so it cannot be shared across surfaces — per-view construction is the necessary platform divergence, to be noted in `22`, not a defect. No executor fixes owed. **headless-done (agent, 2026-06-14).** **Spike resolved → NO:** SwiftUI `.colorEffect` cannot consume a runtime `MTLLibrary` (no public `ShaderLibrary` init over `MTLLibrary`/`MTLFunction`/MSL source, iOS 26.5 SDK), so runtime shaders lower through the **expo-view Metal path even for decorative use** (recorded in `structure.ios.md` § shader). Shipped: JS `registerShader` + registry (collision→curated wins, both-absent reject, idempotent/clean-replacement re-registration, pair-rule null-push) + types + index export; iOS `FxShaderRegistry` + `FxModule.registerShader` + `FxSurfaceView` runtime compile via `makeLibrary(source:)` (fixed `fx_fragment` ABI + prepended preamble, cache by source string); Android `FxShaderRegistry` + `FxModule.registerShader` + `FxSurfaceShaderView`/`FxSurfaceView` AGSL-from-registry (guarded uniform writes incl. time/resolution/intensity, malformed→catch→GONE), registry-aware load/error dispatch; example DEF-008 demo (`runtime-shader.tsx`: working/malformed/iOS-only). Gates green: packages tsc/build/lint/swift:lint/72 tests (8 new registry Tier-1); example tsc; iOS `pod install`+`xcodebuild` **BUILD SUCCEEDED**; Android `:react-native-fx:compileDebugKotlin` **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**. Device gate (6-row runbook in `evidence/device.md`) owns FX-007 closure. Original spec ↓ — Registry-sourced runtime shader compilation — `registerShader({ id, uniforms, source: { ios, android } })` compiles at runtime; `<Fx effect="id" />` stays the only consumption surface (Option A, maintainer-confirmed; no `<Fx source>` prop). The DX win: app-side BYO with no build-path placement and no config plugin (lifts the `22` D6 V1 constraint). **iOS hosted path is a SPIKE-first gate:** no public `ShaderLibrary(source:)` (iOS 26.5 SDK) — `makeLibrary(source:)` serves the expo-view raster path; the spike decides whether SwiftUI `.colorEffect` can consume a runtime `MTLLibrary` (if not, runtime shaders lower through expo-view even for decorative use). Android already runtime-compiles `RuntimeShader` (small delta: accept AGSL from JS). Pinned: dual MSL+AGSL still required (single-source = DEF-001), curated ids win on collision, missing-platform → `{via:'none'}`, compile failure → `onFxError`, cache by `(platform, sourceHash, fn, opts)` not id, explicit re-registration/invalidation rule.

Perf note: the conservative per-frame `setRenderEffect` ran ~60 fps on one surface — keep it, no motivation for `invalidate()`-alone. **BLOCKING DEFECT (device-root-caused): the ripple never started on first mount or after navigate-back** — `startLoop()` was gated on the content container's attach state, but the parent `FxNativeView.onAttachedToWindow → resume()` fires *before* the child container attaches (ViewGroup dispatches the parent's onAttachedToWindow ahead of child attach), so resume saw `attached=false` and bailed with no retry; background→foreground worked only because the view stays attached. **FIX (rework, 2026-06-15, `FxContentDistortion.kt` only, +19): the helper registers a `View.OnAttachStateChangeListener` on the content container** — `onViewAttachedToWindow → startLoop()` if enabled, `onViewDetachedFromWindow → stopLoop()` — the correct attach timing, mirroring how the sibling `FxSurfaceShaderView` (a View) self-manages; `update()/pause()/resume()` untouched (isLooping/stopLoop keep it idempotent); inert below API 33 (isEnabled never flips).

Original spec ↓ — **spec'd (planner, 2026-06-14)** — [task](./tasks/DEF-009/). Android content-distort wrapper, **one curated `ripple` demonstrator**: an AGSL sampler (`uniform shader content;`) applied to `FxSurfaceView`'s existing content container via `RenderEffect.createRuntimeShaderEffect(shader, "content")` — draw-time, so live RN children stay touchable (the rule-#4 inverse of iOS, which stays out-of-scope/no-op). API 33+; below 33 content renders normally (`{via:'none'}`). Mechanical native prop `contentDistortion='ripple'` (NOT the long-term public surface; high-level sugar deferred). Mechanic pinned in `structure.android.md § content-distort`. Device proof = visible distortion + live child touch + animated + loop pauses off-window.

| DEF-021 | 4-runtime | implement | blocked | yes | — | — | trigger: first detached imperative handle (post-v2 impulse API) or per-child control (DEF-002 / the `05` Nitro re-eval) | the true `Fx*` `SharedObject` layer + the discrete `FxEffectRenderer` object + the HybridObject *shape* (`equals`/`dispose`/identity), split from DEF-020 (2026-06-15). Only a *detached* JS-held handle needs it; the view-ref `controlled` write path (DEF-020) does not, so building it now is speculative architecture (the U9 ratification logic) and trips the rule-#7 Nitro boundary. Originally deferred from Unit 9 (2026-06-13): V1 exposes no JS-held handle, so a `SharedObject` has no consumer and the internal objects stay plain native classes (`36` §V1 realization). Keep DEF-020's `setUniform`/`setHighlight` a clean subset so the later swap stays mechanical. |

## DEF-020 — view-ref `controlled` write path (`setUniform` / `setHighlight`)

Type: `implement` · State: `device-pending` · Device: yes · Consumes: — · Closes: — (unblocks DEF-011) · [task](./tasks/DEF-020/)

The minimal half of the original DEF-020 (split accepted by the maintainer, 2026-06-15): the view-ref
imperative write path that `interactionMode="controlled"` needs and DEF-011 (drag/tilt) hard-depends
on. **Discrete writes only** — continuous gesture-sourced motion stays DEF-006; the true SharedObject
layer split to DEF-021. Full spec, authority links, scope in/out, spike, and proof in the task README.

Headless work planner-reviewed clean across two rounds ([review](./reviews/DEF-020.md)): the B1/B2
round (`2288181`) restored cross-platform parity (scalar whitelist `{intensity, pressDepth}` on both
platforms) and removed the Android vec-uniform arity crash; the M2/M4 round (`a1356d7`) clears the
imperative overrides when the mode leaves `controlled` and fixes the `ReactNode` import. All headless
gates re-run independently by the planner (incl. a forced `compileDebugKotlin` = 58 executed). The
`controlled-write` example screen is the device-spike harness (discrete button-tap writes only — no
per-frame JS — plus the force-host-re-render clobber test).

## EX-002 — 100-cell mixed-effect stress list

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Device: yes · Consumes: — · Closes: — (critique-routed F14, no ledger row) · [task](./tasks/EX-002/)

Origin: critique F14. A standing device-verify scenario (not a throwaway) that converts the F1/F2
per-instance-Metal / scroll-cost critique from theoretical to measured, and is where U4-003's
deferred multi-instance shared-context proof gets run.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd ([README](./tasks/EX-002/README.md))
- [x] rules-gated (#1 native owns the frame loop under scroll; #3 mixes the two substrates only;
      #9 reads layout — plain RN cells)
- [x] implemented (`example/screens/stress-list.tsx` + registration)
- [x] commented (iceberg — why the cell mix, why virtualized, the deterministic generator)
- [x] headless-done (example `bunx tsc --noEmit` green; example screens carry no unit tier)
- [x] device-verified (maintainer-ratified 2026-06-11 on the PASS evidence — (a)/(c)/a11y full, (b) full on Android hardware, partial on the iOS sim by tooling limits; `evidence/device.md`)
- [x] reviewed (reviewer, 2026-06-11 — `../reviews/device-batch-2026-06-11.md`)
- [x] merged (maintainer, 2026-06-11, on integration/0.1.x)

Change (JS-only — `example/`, no `packages/` native):
- **`screens/stress-list.tsx`** (`StressListScreen`) — a virtualized `FlatList` of 100
  deterministic cells, four kinds cycling by `index % 4`: `shader` (`FxSurfaceView shader={id}` —
  the expo-view Metal path U4-003 reworked), `fill` + `material` (`FxHostedView` — the hosted
  path), and `motion` (`FxSurfaceView` wrapping content with no shader → no MTKView). Shader cells
  cycle the ten curated ids so the pipeline cache holds several keys with repeats. Per-cell
  captions name the kind + shader id for device correlation.
- **`data/tasks.ts`** — `"stress-list"` added to `DemoScreen`; an `EX-002` `TASKS` entry.
- **`app/(tasks)/[taskId].tsx`** — `StressListScreen` import + `case "stress-list"` in `renderDemo`.

Why `FxSurfaceView` (not `FxHostedView`) for shader cells: the lazy-MTKView + process-shared static
Metal context lives in `FxSurfaceView.swift`; proofs (a)/(c) target that path. `FxHostedView` runs
the separate hosted Metal lane and serves the fill/material cells.

Proof:
- headless: `bunx tsc --noEmit` from `example/` — green. No example lint gate (Biome scopes to
  `packages/src`); the file uses tab indentation matching sibling screens. `packages/` untouched.
- device: `tasks/EX-002/evidence/device.md` — (a) multi-instance shared Metal context (one
  device/queue, same-id pipeline reuse), (b) scroll perf on the mixed list (no per-frame JS / jank),
  (c) shader-less cells allocate zero MTKView at scale; plus the a11y row. iOS owns (a)/(c);
  both platforms run (b). The human gate.
- docs: none — critique-routed, no ledger row.

## U1-006 — drop FxGroupView from the public index

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: — (critique-routed, no ledger row)

Origin: critique F9. `src/index.ts` is the declared stability contract, and the grouped-substrate
binding is an inert stub — its native `FxGroupView` does nothing until the morph compound (DEF-006
/ `FxGroup` high-level component) lands. Exporting it publishes API surface the runtime can't honor.
The fix narrows the public surface; nothing else moves.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd (single-line export removal; trivial — tracked as a detail block, not a folder)
- [x] rules-gated (no rule touched — a public-surface narrowing; #2/#3/#7/#9 untouched)
- [x] implemented (dropped the `FxGroupView` + `NativeFxGroupProps` export from `src/index.ts:12`)
- [x] commented (no new code; the index header comment still reads true)
- [x] headless-done
- [x] reviewed (reviewer, 2026-06-11 — approved: export cut verified in the built `index.d.ts` (zero refs), no stray imports in `example/`/`skills/`/`packages/src`, binding + web stub + native registration correctly kept; no separate review doc for a one-line change)
- [x] merged (maintainer, 2026-06-11, on integration/0.1.x)

Change (TS-only):
- **`src/index.ts`** — removed `export { FxGroupView, type NativeFxGroupProps } from './runtime/FxGroupView'`.
  The built `index.d.ts` now exposes only `FxHostedView` + `FxSurfaceView` substrate hosts.
- **Kept:** `src/runtime/FxGroupView.tsx` (the binding), `src/runtime/FxGroupView.web.tsx` (the web
  stub that imports `NativeFxGroupProps` from it), and the inert native `FxGroupView` registration.
  Only the public re-export was cut.
- **Not touched:** the `index.ts` header comment listing the future high-level vocabulary
  (`Fx`, `FxGroup`, `FxItem`) — those are the unbuilt high-level components, not this low-level
  binding, so the comment stays accurate.

No `FxGroupView` / `NativeFxGroupProps` import exists anywhere in `example/` or `skills/` (grepped
both, plus `packages/src`); the only other reference is the binding file and its `.web` sibling.

Proof:
- headless: from `packages/` — `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint` (Biome, 19 files
  clean), `bun run test` (34 pass) all green; built `index.d.ts` confirmed to no longer export either
  symbol.
- device: N/A — public-surface narrowing, nothing renders.
- docs: none — critique-routed, no ledger row, no source-doc decision.

## DOC-014 — runtime-binding ref cleanup

Type: `doc-cleanup` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: — (no ledger row)

Reconciles the phantom/stale runtime-binding and folder refs in `architecture.md` + `data-layer.md`
to the real package. Scope widened per audit-2026-06-09 S1.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated (docs-only; no rule touched)
- [x] docs reconciled
- [ ] reviewed (maintainer)
- [ ] merged (maintainer)

Edits made (grounded against the shipped package):
- **`architecture.md` §1 runtime block (`:55-58`)** — dropped **all three** phantom bindings
  (`FxManagedView` + `FxPresenceView` + `FxPressableView`). Revised from the initial S1 disposition
  after grounding: there are only 3 registered native views, so the runtime layer has exactly 3
  bindings (`FxHostedView`/`FxSurfaceView`/`FxGroupView`, at `packages/ios/FxModule.swift:12,31,53`;
  `android/.../FxModule.kt:19,38,60`). Presence/press are `expo-view` (rule #3) — they route through
  `FxSurfaceView` + a coordinator/recognizer object and ship as `src/surface/` components, never their
  own `requireNativeView` bindings. `src/surface/` currently holds only `types.ts` (components not yet built).
- **`architecture.md` §1 manifest (`:29`)** — `CapabilityManifest.ts (the data)` → `index.ts (the
  manifest barrel)`. Real manifest files are `index.ts`/`select.ts`/`types.ts`; `CapabilityManifest`
  is a *type* in `types.ts`, and the manifest *data* is not shipped in `src/` (test fixture only).
  **Note:** `:29` was not in the S1-enumerated ref set, but it is the identical phantom as
  `data-layer:693` — fixed for tree-consistency.
- **`architecture.md` §2 Path-2 flow (`:323`)** — `src/runtime/FxPresenceView.tsx` →
  `src/runtime/FxSurfaceView.tsx` (the real binding the JSX lowers to today; matches the
  `requireNativeView('ReactNativeFx','FxSurfaceView')` line beneath it).
- **`architecture.md` §9 unit map (`:556-557`)** — Unit 7/8 native = `FxSurfaceView` + the
  coordinator/recognizer object (not a dedicated view); JS = `src/surface/FxPresence.tsx` /
  `FxPressable.tsx` (planned). Added a footnote phrasing this as the current direction, with
  object/view granularity formally open per RT-008.
- **`decision-ledger.md` RT-008 row (`:170`)** — reconciled the stale "five-view object model"
  provisioned-value wording to the **3-view** reality (the same phantom drift one level up — five =
  3 real + the 2 phantom presence/press views). RT-008 stays **open**: its real subject is
  runtime-object granularity (driver family-split + scheduling), still open in `36`/DOC-011. Doc
  bodies (`architecture.md §2`, `data-layer.md §9 D1`) were already correct at 3 views — no body edit needed.
- **`architecture.md` §1 podspec (`:77`)** — `react-native-fx.podspec` → `ReactNativeFx.podspec`
  (real file; dropped the now-satisfied `[IMPL-001: post-identity-pass name]` prediction).
- **`data-layer.md` §9 entity diagram (`:693`, `:724-726`)** — manifest `CapabilityManifest.ts` →
  `index.ts (public API)`; runtime box dropped `FxManagedView`, marked Presence/Pressable
  `(planned — Unit 7/8)`. Box ASCII alignment preserved.
- **DOC-014's own pointer** — the widened row text already cites "entity-diagram src-tree", not
  `§5.1`; no further pointer fix needed (`§5.1` is the Memoization section, correctly distinct).

Proof:
- headless: N/A — docs-only, no code changed.
- device: N/A.
- docs: `architecture.md` §1/§2/§9; `data-layer.md` §9 entity diagram. No ledger row (cleanup only).

## DOC-015 — SURF-010 plane-1 re-closure

Type: `doc-cleanup` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: SURF-010 (re-close)

Fixes the cardinal-rule slip flagged in audit-2026-06-09 S3: SURF-010 (memoization guidance) was
closed against plane-7 `data-layer §5.1`, not its named plane-1 source `50`/`54`/`55`. Took the
**propagate** path (Option A): the guidance now lives in the owning surface docs, so the row closes
in source.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated (docs-only)
- [x] guidance propagated to `50`/`54`/`55` §Open questions (resolved in source)
- [x] ledger SURF-010 reconciliation verb flipped `propagate` → `resolved`; main row + `data-layer §5.1` re-pointed
- [ ] reviewed (maintainer)
- [ ] merged (maintainer)

Edits made:
- **`50-api-and-presets.md` §Open questions** — memoization bullet struck through and resolved:
  no manual memo (native `previousProps` value-equality; React Compiler memoizes automatically).
- **`54-presence.md` §Open questions** — `uniforms`/`tune` memoization bullet resolved (same as `50`).
- **`55-composition-chain.md` §Open questions** — `EffectStack` memoization bullet resolved.
- **`decision-ledger.md`** — main SURF-010 row close-condition re-pointed to `50`/`54`/`55`
  §Open questions; the Reconciliation row verb flipped `propagate` → `resolved (DOC-015)`.
- **`data-layer.md §5.1`** — header note clarifies plane 7 *materializes* the guidance; closure
  lives in the plane-1 source docs.

Proof:
- headless: N/A — docs-only.
- device: N/A.
- docs: `50`/`54`/`55` §Open questions; `decision-ledger.md` SURF-010 (both rows); `data-layer.md §5.1`.

## DOC-009 — driver-model ratification

Type: `ratify` · State: `ready-to-merge` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: MOT-003, MOT-005, MOT-006, MOT-009 · [task](./tasks/DOC-009/)

Promotes the research/wip driver-model rethink (maintainer-accepted 2026-06-10) into the
canonical docs and closes the four open motion-vocabulary rows. Scope widened from the
original "`40`/`41`/`42` V1 motion vocab scope" to carry the spine vocabulary (`02`), the
maintainer-ratified U6-001 spring-preflight dispositions (`34` + `structure.*`), and the
`Transition.spring` consumers (`55`, `data-layer`).

The three maintainer decisions recorded (2026-06-10):

1. **Substrate-tiered slicing; rule #4 holds.** Motion channels and effect uniforms are both
   animatable properties bound to native drivers — `target`/`clock`/`source`. Content motion
   (`expo-view`) gets full-fidelity `target`/`clock` and a best-effort `source`; render-server
   `source` fidelity and all effect-uniform animation live in the hosted effects lane.
   `source`'s guarantee is "zero per-frame JS", not "zero per-frame native". Build order:
   `target`+`clock`, then `source` (V2), then hosted effect-uniform animation.
2. **iOS 17 floor for spring content motion** — the `02` content rung moves `os:13` → `os:17`
   (`SwiftUI.Spring` only; below 17 the ladder degrades to `{via:'none'}`, instant placement).
3. **Render-server-first, integrator-on-retarget** for the iOS content lane (the `FxSpring`
   facade over `SwiftUI.Spring`; the touch caveat flips to visual-position while it runs).

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated (docs-only; the slicing exists to honor rule #4; per-platform spring
      authoring is the law applied to timing)
- [x] docs-closed (`02` Decision #14 + content rung; `40` Decision #7; `41` Decisions
      #10–#12; `42` Decision #6; `34` §Findings — iOS spring disposition + caveat flip +
      Android spring gate; `structure.{ios,android}.md` motion content mechanics; `55` +
      `data-layer.md` `Transition.spring`; MOT-003/005/006/009 → resolved; MOT-007 reframed
      (stays deferred, DEF-006); RT-016 reworded (stays device-pending, U6-002); wip folded —
      rethink deleted, preflight moved to `tasks/U6-001/preflight.md`)
- [ ] reviewed (maintainer)
- [ ] merged (maintainer)

Proof:
- headless: N/A — docs-only, no code changed.
- device: N/A — RT-016 stays with U6-002; MOT-001/MOT-002 catalog values stay device-pending.
- docs: as listed under docs-closed above.

## U1-001 — package scaffolding

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Closes: SHIP-001, IMPL-001 · [task](./tasks/U1-001-package-scaffolding/)

Through `reviewed` ([review](./reviews/U1-001.md), approved). `docs-closed` is **complete** — both `Closes:` rows true in source:

- **SHIP-001 — closed.** `package.json` matches `52` (root `exports`, `files` allowlist shipping
  both shader trees, `publishConfig` public, `FxShader` dropped); `npm pack --dry-run` verified.
- **IMPL-001 — resolved (2026-06-09).** The scaffolding pass landed headless,
  but IMPL-001 closes only when its consumed rows do. **RT-010** resolved (U1-003, 2026-06-08);
  **REAL-002** resolved (U3-005, 2026-06-09 — build-verified, not device);
  **SHIP-001** resolved (U1-001). All three consumed rows are closed.
- **`apple.podspecPath`** declared in `packages/expo-module.config.json` (U1-004 finding) — makes
  autolinking install-method-agnostic. Recorded in the IMPL-001 package-identity context.

So U1-001's `docs-closed` gate is **satisfied** — IMPL-001 (and all its consumed rows: SHIP-001, RT-010, REAL-002) are resolved in their source docs. **Merged on integration/0.1.x (2026-06-09).**

## U4-001 — wrapper mechanic

Type: `rework` · State: `merged` · Consumes: RT-015 · Closes: RT-015

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated
- [x] source docs reconciled (`33`, `34` decide the target object)
- [x] `architecture.md` / `data-layer.md` / `blueprint.md` updated to match (consumers, not sources)
- [x] device proof defined (scenario in `tasks/U4-001-wrapper-mechanic/evidence/device.md`)
- [x] device proof observed (maintainer-verified iOS + Android, 2026-06-09 — child mounts into the container, hit-test survives at rest; via the U4-002 device run)
- [x] ledger RT-015 closed (true in `33`/`34`)
- [x] merged (couple-merge with U4-002)

Proof:
- headless: N/A
- device: mount an RN child inside `FxSurfaceView`; confirm the child rides the animated intermediate container and hit-testing survives at rest (mid-flight caveat per `34`)
- docs: `33`, `34`, `architecture.md`, `data-layer.md`, `blueprint.md`, decision-ledger RT-015

## U4-002 — mountChildComponentView override

Type: `device-verify` · State: `merged` · Consumes: — · Closes: RT-014 · [task](./tasks/U4-002-mountChildComponentView/)

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd

  - [x] commented
  - [x] TS+format-green (tsc/build/lint/test pass; swift-format clean)
  - [x] native-compile-verified (iOS local xcodebuild BUILD SUCCESSFUL; Android local gradle BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
  - [x] Android reimplemented — full `ExpoBlurTargetView.kt` override family + the no-`super.onLayout` fix (the `LinearLayout`-traversal crash) + onMeasure/onLayout sizing (0×0 fix)
  - [x] iOS reimplemented — symmetric mount/unmount + superview guard; spurious default shader (`pendingShader=""`) + free-running MTKView loop (pause when no effect) fixed; diagnostics removed
  - [x] device-verified (maintainer, iOS + Android, 2026-06-09 — mount/unmount confirmed via logs; smooth show/hide; taps land; Android crash gone)
  - [x] docs-closed (RT-014 mechanic + the corrected templates pinned in `structure.{ios,android}`; `33` fallback note; reference fan-out captured)
  - [x] reviewed (diffed against `ExpoBlurTargetView`/`expo-glass` templates; root causes confirmed fixed)
  - [x] merged

Proof:
- headless: `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`, `bun run swift:lint`, `bun run test` from `packages/` all pass. `git diff --check` clean.
- native compile:
  - **iOS:** `xcodebuild` (Debug, iphonesimulator) on Xcode 26.5 → BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Diagnostic logging added to both `mountChildComponentView` and `unmountChildComponentView` to diagnose the "child won't unmount" symptom on device.
  - **Android:** `./gradlew :react-native-fx:compileDebugKotlin` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Reimplemented to match `expo-blur` `ExpoBlurTargetView.kt` exactly: full `addView`/`removeView`/`updateViewLayout`/`onMeasure`/`onLayout` family with identity guards. `onMeasure` added (explicit `setMeasuredDimension` + `intermediateContainer.measure`) as the missing half of the 0×0 fix.
- device: mount an RN child inside `<FxSurfaceView>` (no `shader` prop — `metalView` hidden), confirm it lands in the intermediate container, renders correctly (layout + draw, not 0×0), and hit-testing survives. The scenario must exercise layout, draw, and touch correctness. **iOS: capture console logs and answer:** (1) does `unmountChildComponentView` fire on hide? (2) if it fires, does `removeFromSuperview()` remove the child? (3) is there double-parenting (`self.subviews` vs `intermediateContainer.subviews`)? Mid-flight caveat per `34`.
- docs: `structure.ios.md` / `structure.android.md` — intermediate container mechanic + effect surface visibility rule + explicit layout note; `34` — open item about effect↔content composition.

## U4-003 — lazy Metal + shared static Metal context

Type: `rework` · State: `merged` · Device: yes · Consumes: — · Closes: — (no ledger row) · [task](./tasks/U4-003/)

Origin: critique F2 (HIGH) + F11's sharing half. `FxSurfaceView` is the `expo-view` substrate
every V2 motion/press/presence component rides; on iOS it allocated Metal eagerly and
per-instance, so wrapping a long list multiplied `MTKView`s/queues/libraries to animate
transforms that draw no shader.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated (perf rework; #1/#3/#7/#9 hold, no tension)
- [x] implemented (lazy `MTKView`; static shared device/queue/library/pipeline cache)
- [x] commented (iceberg — why lazy, why process-lived, main-thread cache access)
- [x] headless-done
- [x] device-verified (maintainer-ratified 2026-06-11 on the PASS evidence — iOS 26 sim, agent-device, log-instrumented build reverted after; `tasks/U4-003/evidence/device.md` §Results; multi-instance shared-context proof rides EX-002)
- [x] reviewed (2026-06-11, approved — `../reviews/U4-003.md`)
- [x] docs-closed (`structure.ios.md` §Lifecycle mechanic pinned; no ledger row)
- [x] merged (maintainer, 2026-06-11, on integration/0.1.x)

Change (iOS-only — `packages/ios/FxSurfaceView.swift`):
- **Lazy Metal** — `init` builds only the content container; the `MTKView` (now `MTKView?`)
  is created by `ensureEffectSurface()` on the first active `shader`. A content-motion-only
  surface allocates no GPU view.
- **Process-shared Metal context** — `device`/`commandQueue`/`library`/`pipelineCache` moved
  to `private static` (one device, one queue, the one bundled `default.metallib`, a
  `shaderId`-keyed pipeline cache valid across instances because the pixel format is the fixed
  `bgra8Unorm`). Process-lived; `deinit` releases only the per-view `MTKView`.
- **Android** — unchanged; `FxSurfaceView.kt` holds no GPU resources. The cadence half of F11
  is out of scope (split to U2-003).

Proof:
- headless: from `packages/` — `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`,
  `bun run swift:lint`, `bun run test` (26 pass); `git diff --check` clean. Native:
  `xcodebuild` (Debug, iphonesimulator, Xcode 26.5) on `reactnativefxexample` → BUILD
  SUCCEEDED (after a `pod install` to refresh a stale Pods project — see `tasks/U4-003/notes.md`).
- device: **PASS** (2026-06-11, iOS 26 sim iPhone 17 Pro, agent-device on a log-only-instrumented
  build, reverted after). Exactly one `MTKView` allocation across the session, only on the first
  active shader; content-motion-only mount = zero alloc; child mount + hit-test intact; lazy
  `loop` rendered (not blank); reuse + fresh re-mount = no extra alloc; isolated teardown, no
  crash. Full log + screenshots in `evidence/device.md` §Results. Multi-instance shared-context
  (EX-002 list) + GPU-capture variant left as the maintainer's confirmation. Formal device-verified
  tick is the maintainer's.
- docs: `structure.ios.md` §Lifecycle (lazy effect surface + process-shared Metal context). No
  ledger row.

## U2-003 — CapabilityManifest data + typed config + conformance + cadence

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Device: yes (two carry-in scenarios) · Consumes: — · Closes: — (critique-routed, no ledger row) · [task](./tasks/U2-003/)

Origin: critique F3+F6+F11 (audit G1) + the two U4-003-review carry-ins. Makes the capability
manifest canonical and shipped, ties the dispatch renderings together, derives per-effect typed
config from it, adds the `cadence` schema hint, and wires the declared-but-dead surface events.

- **TS (headless):** `src/manifest/manifest.ts` (canonical `as const` manifest, all V1 nodes,
  reconciled to shipped native, `cadence` on animated rungs); `src/manifest/config.ts`
  (`ConfigFor<NodeId>` type-level derivation + build-failing assertions vs `MaterialConfig`/
  `SymbolConfig`); `types.ts` (`Cadence`, `cadence?`, `'string'`, readonly); `catalog.ts`
  (`CURATED_SHADER_IDS` → `ShaderId`); `manifest-conformance.test.ts` (ids ↔ MSL ↔ AGSL ↔ assets);
  `manifest-select.test.ts` repointed off the inline fixture; `FxSurfaceView.tsx` wraps the binding
  to coerce `shader ?? ''` + adds the load/error props.
- **Native (compile-verified; behavior device-pending):** `ios/FxSurfaceView.swift` — `fragmentName`
  → `String?`, `dispatchShaderLoadState()` fires `onFxLoad`/`onFxError` once per change.
  `android/.../FxSurfaceView.kt` — `FxShaderEvent` Record payload + asset-open/compile load proof.
- **Docs:** `02` (schema + decisions 15/16, typed-config Open question resolved); `data-layer §1`
  (canonical pointer + reconciled rungs + cadence); `structure.{ios,android}.md` `§shader` (events +
  reset contract + raster-subset note).

Proof:
- headless: from `packages/` — `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`,
  `bun run swift:lint`, `bun run test` (34 pass); `git diff --check` clean. Native: `pod install`
  then `xcodebuild` (Debug, iphonesimulator) → BUILD SUCCEEDED; `./gradlew
  :react-native-fx:compileDebugKotlin` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- device: shader-reset (undefined clears) + `onFxLoad`/`onFxError` fire once (iOS raster subset
  now errors instead of wrong-rendering); scenarios in `tasks/U2-003/notes.md`.
- docs: `02`, `data-layer §1`, `structure.{ios,android}.md`. No ledger row.

## U3-002 — hosting parity / glass styles / uniforms (scope note)

Type: `device-verify` (hybrid — includes a library prep step) · State: `merged` · Device: yes ·
Consumes: — · Closes: SPINE-012, FX-002, FX-005 (all closed 2026-06-10) · Blocked by: U3-001 · [task](./tasks/U3-002/) · [review](./reviews/U3-002.md)

Scope folded in (Planner, 2026-06-10): **FX-002 (glass styles) cannot be device-verified until
the library exposes a glass-style channel.** Landed (2026-06-10) as the `materialConfig` config
channel (mirrors `symbolConfig`, per `21` §The typed inputs — `variant: 'regular'|'clear'` +
`interactive`; `.identity` deliberately not adopted), in order:

1. **The library prep** — `materialConfig` on `FxHostedView` (TS `NativeFxHostedProps`) +
   `FxModule` `Prop` + `FxMaterialView` applying the `Glass` variant and `.interactive()` on
   iOS 26. Done.
2. **The example selector** — the glass section on the `hosting-parity` screen (variant
   segmented control + press-response toggle, glass tile inside the scroller). Done.
3. **The glass-style device check** (scenario in `tasks/U3-002/evidence/headless.md`). Human gate.

FX-005 (uniform alignment) and SPINE-012 (hosting parity / many boundaries / GPU resume) are
pure device-verify against the EX-001 harness — no library work. The scenarios live in
`tasks/U3-002/evidence/headless.md` (the sweep docs were retired 2026-06-10; history in git).

## U3-001 — hosted effect renderer

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Device: yes · Consumes: — · Closes: RT-009 · [task](./tasks/U3-001-effect-renderer-hosted/) · [review](./reviews/U3-001.md)

Scope (Option A): U3-001 owns the hosted authoring path + fill + iOS material — the RT-009 slice.
The shader rung moved to U3-006 and the iOS symbol rung to U3-007; those are separate tasks, not
blockers on this one.

Proof:
- headless: `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test` from `packages/`.
  Renderer logic is device-gated — effects do not run headless.
- device: RT-009 verified on iOS 26+ and Android (2026-06-08) — hosted mount + prop/config path;
  fill on both platforms; iOS material via `.glassEffect()`. Android material → U3-003 / FX-003;
  shader rung → U3-006; iOS symbol → U3-007. Evidence in
  `tasks/U3-001-effect-renderer-hosted/evidence/device.md`.
- docs: `51` RT-009 closed (hosted authoring path proven); `structure.android.md` records the V1
  deviation (plain View fill, Compose deferred); `structure.ios.md` records the hosted material path.

## U3-006 — curated shader implementation

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Device: yes · Consumes: FX-004, REAL-004 · Closes: — · [task](./tasks/U3-006/)

Scope: implement the committed V1 shader catalog on the hosted renderer slice. The public
`ShaderId` widens only when all ten curated ids have native coverage: MSL for all ten ids on iOS
and AGSL for all ten ids on Android. DOC-013's pair rule means Android AGSL covers the original
five ids too, not only `aurora` / `noise-field` / `plasma` / `caustics` / `edge-glow`.

- [x] rules-gated
- [x] implemented
- [x] commented
- [x] headless-done
- [x] device-verified
- [x] docs-closed
- [x] reviewed
- [x] merged

Proof:
- headless: from `packages/`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`,
  `bun run swift:lint`, and `bun run test`; from the repo root, `git diff --check`.
  All green (2026-06-08). 18 Jest tests pass; TS build produces widened ShaderId in `.d.ts`;
  Biome clean; swift-format clean.
- device: iOS 17+ and Android API 33+ render every curated shader id; `intensity` updates from a
  discrete prop; `time` advances natively while visible; shader switching has no stale pixels or
  crash; navigation/backgrounding pause and resume the native clock. Scenario in
  `tasks/U3-006/evidence/headless.md`.
  - **Android: PASS (2026-06-08)** — all ten AGSL shaders on a POCO F1 (API 35); blank-on-switch and
    intensity-drag flicker fixes both confirmed live.
  - **iOS: PASS (2026-06-08)** — verified by the maintainer on iOS 17+; shaders render through the
    hosted Metal path. Evidence in `tasks/U3-006/evidence/device.md`. (REAL-002/REAL-003 ledger
    closures remain owned by U3-005.)
- docs: **closed (2026-06-08).** `22` reconciled — all ten ids ship with native MSL+AGSL and are
  package-exposed (the "first five only" wording is gone, Decision 2 updated). `structure.android.md`
  carries the shipped hosted-shader mechanics (layout fix + discrete-uniform-in-place). `structure.ios.md`
  hosted-shader mechanic reads true; the metallib-bundle-resolution detail stays with U3-005/REAL-002.
  This tracker moved.

## U3-005 — shader asset packaging + runtime load proof

Type: `device-verify` (hybrid — see below) · State: `merged` · Device: yes · Consumes: — · Closes: REAL-002, REAL-003 · [task](./tasks/U3-005/)

Spec'd 2026-06-09. **Reframed:** the `device-verify` label undersells it — the dominant work
is **doc-cleanup + closure-reconciliation**, with a thin device/build residual.

- **REAL-002 (iOS metallib)** — close condition is "build verification on the pinned toolchain",
  an **agent-ownable Tier-3 build-artifact check**, not the human device gate. Build-verified on
  Xcode 26.5 / Swift 6.3.2 (2026-06-09): `FxShaders.bundle` emitted unmangled with
  `default.metallib` (194 KB) at the bundle root. `structure.ios.md` §Render paths records the
  `resource_bundles` + `MTL_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIR` mechanism and the `ShaderLibrary(url:)` hosted-path
  loader. `52` Findings section records the resolution.
- **REAL-003 (Android AGSL path)** — mis-statused `open`. The path is chosen and shipped
  (`android/src/main/assets/shaders/*.agsl`, read via `context.assets.open(...)`) and device-proven
  on U3-006 (POCO F1, API 35). Path recorded in `structure.android.md` §Render paths; `52` Open
  questions cleared. Row resolved.
- **No new device gate:** REAL-003's render is proven on U3-006; REAL-002 is a build check done on
  the pinned toolchain. No fresh device run required.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd

## U3-004 — BYO registration contract

Type: `ratify` · State: `ready-to-merge` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: `FX-006` · [task](./tasks/U3-004/)

Ratifies the V1 BYO (bring-your-own) shader registration contract in the owning source doc (`22-shaders.md`) and propagates it to `data-layer.md` §7. The contract is end-to-end: registration, consumption, typing, and unregistered-id behavior.

## U1-004 — bare Fabric example in CI

Type: `implement` · State: `merged` · Closes: SHIP-003 · [task](./tasks/U1-004-bare-fabric-example-ci/)

- [x] reviewed
- [x] merged

Progress (CI green — all 4 jobs on GitHub):
- **Bare fixture built + verified locally:** `example-bare/` — literal bare RN 0.85.3 / New-Arch
  app (bun, committed `ios/`+`android/`), Expo Modules via `install-expo-modules`,
  `react-native-fx` as `file:../packages`. Both platforms autolink fx (iOS `Podfile.lock` →
  `ReactNativeFx (0.1.0)`; Android resolver → `expo.modules.reactnativefx.FxModule`).
  **iOS compile: BUILD SUCCEEDED, 0 errors** — `FxBareExample.app` built, fx Swift + Metal
  (`FxShaders.metal` → bundled `default.metallib`) compiled in. Mandatory native-compile gate met.
- **Library fix (carries into the package):** declared `apple.podspecPath` in
  `packages/expo-module.config.json` — without it bun's `file:` file-symlink install hides the
  podspec from Expo's scanner and fx never links on iOS. Makes autolinking install-method-agnostic;
  should be recorded as a library config change (IMPL-001 / RT-010 area). See task notes.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has `typescript` + `swift` (library, locally green) + `bare-ios`
  (install → Metal-toolchain download → `pod install` → `Podfile.lock` assert → `xcodebuild`) +
  `bare-android` (install → autolink assert, package id + module class). All 4 jobs green on
  GitHub (`macos-26` for Swift 6.2).
- **Proof:** CI green on GitHub — all 4 jobs pass. iOS autolink + native compile proven; Android
  autolink proven. `apple.podspecPath` library-config change on main.

Proof:
- headless: package build/lint (green); CI all 4 jobs green — iOS autolink + native compile proven; Android autolink proven.
- device: N/A — U1-003 owns runtime/device verification.
- docs: `53` open question closed (Bare + Fabric CI); SHIP-003 resolved in ledger. `apple.podspecPath` library-config change recorded.

## DOC-002 — ratify SPINE-004/005/006/007

Type: `ratify` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: SPINE-004, SPINE-007 · [task](./tasks/DOC-002/)

Ratifies the `02` open questions that are ripe and honestly defers the ones that are not.

**Closed (2 of 4):**
- **SPINE-004** — `composition` (background/overlay/surface) is an **API-layer prop** (`50` / `<Fx>`), not a manifest field. `02` Decision 12 records this.
- **SPINE-007** — `via:'lib'` naming: `applyVia` names the library (e.g., `Haze`), `asset` names the asset type (e.g., `lottie`). No version in the manifest — managed by the app's optional peer dependency (`53` decision 6). `02` Decision 13 records this.

**Deferred (2 of 4) — no premature decision:**
- **SPINE-005** — feature-flag vocabulary + multiple assets per rung. Deferred: no real shader or feature case forces it in V1. Revisit when a non-OS capability flag or multiple assets per rung is needed.
- **SPINE-006** — manifest partitioning. Deferred: the manifest stays one file for V1; split when the node count makes rendering unwieldy.

## DOC-010 — reduce-motion policy ratification

Type: `ratify` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: MOT-010 · [task](./tasks/DOC-010/)

The motion domain had no policy for honoring OS reduce-motion / animation-scale settings.
This task ratifies the V1 policy: **instant degradation** (0-duration, snap to target)
when the OS setting is active. Implementation is owned by U6-001 (FxAnimationDriver, v2).

- **iOS:** `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled` → driver sets duration to 0.
- **Android:** `Settings.Global.TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE` = 0.0 (or
  `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` = 0.0) → driver sets duration to 0.
- **Scope:** All content motion (presence enter/exit, state transitions). Presets and
  explicit `motion` overrides are both degraded. Opacity-only degradation is a deferred
  V2 refinement. Decorative effects have their own native clock and are not gated in V1.

Checklist:

Type: `ratify` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: SPINE-001, SPINE-002 · [task](./tasks/DOC-003/)

Ratifies the curation/BYO threshold and the palettes-as-artifact disposition.

**SPINE-001 — curation/BYO threshold:**
- `00` Decision #6: the V1 threshold is the 10 curated shader ids (`22`) plus the ratified preset/feedback/effect vocabularies (`50`/`56`). Anything outside the curated set is BYO (developer-supplied `.metal`+`.agsl` via the `shader` node). The compiler/emitter (`03`) is deferred until real novel-composition demand triggers it.
- The `00` open question "Where curation ends and BYO begins" is struck through and resolved.

**SPINE-002 — palettes/themes as artifact:**
- `52` Decision #11: palettes and themes as a shareable distribution artifact are deferred to V2. Pure-config palettes resolve in JS within the core package (`presets/`). A distribution surface would live in `@react-native-fx/lab` if demand justifies the split.
- The `50` open question "Theme distribution" is struck through and resolved.
- `52` Decision #10 already named `@react-native-fx/lab` as the home for "where curation ends"; Decision #11 makes the palettes-as-artifact link explicit.

## DOC-004 — ratify SURF-002

Type: `ratify` · State: `merged` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: SURF-002 · [task](./tasks/DOC-004/)

Ratifies the criterion for shipping named effect components and the V1 set that passes it.

**SURF-002 — ship effect components?**
- `56` Decision 4: named effect components ship only when the effect is drawn whole by fx (rule #5), is standalone-useful without wrapped content, and the canonical API remains `<Fx effect="…">`. The V1 set that passes this test today is `EdgeGlow`. `MeshGradient` is a fill style, reached via `<Fx effect="mesh-gradient">` (or `fx.effect.mesh()`), not a standalone component.
- `56` Decision 6: `EdgeGlow` ships as a component. `MeshGradient` does not. These are sugar over effects already in the curated catalog (DOC-003, SPINE-001) — not new surface. They export from the core package, not `@react-native-fx/lab` (consistent with `52` Decision #10).
- `52` Decision 12: ratifies the same V1 set and criterion in the ship plane.
- `55` line 11: curated effect preset wording updated to `EdgeGlow` only.
- The `56` and `52` open questions are struck through and resolved.

- [x] reviewed (passed — closures grounded in `56`/`57`/`41`; vocab cross-checked against `42` catalog + behavior-named law and the Reanimated motion-primitive altitude; split held; no separate doc)
- [x] merged

Proof:
- headless: `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test` from `packages/` — all green.
- device: N/A — ratification task.
- docs: `50`/`56`/`57` vocab ratified; `41`/`42` preset sets ratified; `data-layer.md` §3 MOT-001 pointer added; ledger SURF-003/004/005 → resolved. Springs remain device-pending with MOT-001.

## DOC-006 — FxGroup morph scope ratification

Type: `ratify` · State: `ready-to-merge` · Device: no · Consumes: — · Closes: SURF-006 · [task](./tasks/DOC-006/)

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated
- [x] docs-closed
  - [x] `57` — Decision 6 records glass-only morph scope, iOS 26+ / system-owned merge, Android flat fallback
  - [x] `57` — Open question struck
  - [x] `21` — Decision 5 records glass-morph as the only V1 compound effect
  - [x] `21` — Open question struck
  - [x] `data-layer.md` §10 reconciled to ratified wording
- [x] ledger SURF-006 closed (true in `57`/`21`)
- [ ] reviewed (maintainer)
- [ ] merged (maintainer)

Proof:
- headless: N/A — docs-only.
- device: N/A — ratification task.
- docs: `57` §Decisions (Decision 6), `21` §Decisions (Decision 5), `data-layer.md` §10; `decision-ledger.md` SURF-006 → `resolved`.

## U3-007 — iOS symbol effect

Type: `implement` · State: `headless-done` · Device: yes · Consumes: `FX-009` · Closes: — · Blocked by: `DOC-008`, `U3-001` · [task](./tasks/U3-007/)

Implement iOS `symbol` via `.symbolEffect` on the hosted slice. Android symbol deferred (planned, non-selectable), confirmed by `select()` tests.

Checklist:
- [x] spec'd
- [x] rules-gated
- [x] implemented
  - [x] `FxSymbolView.swift` — `.symbolEffect` on iOS 17+ (bounce/pulse/scale/appear/disappear/variableColor), iOS 18 adds breathe/rotate/wiggle, `.contentTransition(.symbolEffect(.automatic))` for symbol→symbol, degrades below 17
  - [x] `FxHostedView.swift` — `symbolConfig` dispatch path before `effect` path
  - [x] `FxModule.swift` — `Prop("symbolConfig")` registered
  - [x] `src/effects/catalog.ts` — `SymbolAnimation` and `SymbolConfig` types exported
  - [x] `src/runtime/FxHostedView.tsx` — `symbolConfig` added to `NativeFxHostedProps`
  - [x] `src/index.ts` — exports the new symbol types
- [x] commented
- [x] headless-done
  - [x] `bunx tsc --noEmit` green
  - [x] `bun run build` green
  - [x] `bun run lint` green
  - [x] `bun run swift:lint` green
  - [x] `xcodebuild` native compile: **BUILD SUCCEEDED** (Xcode 26.5, iPhone 17 sim, iOS 26.5)
  - [x] `bun run test` green (21 tests pass, 3 new symbol tests)
  - [x] `structure.ios.md` diff check: zero changes (consumed, not edited)
- [ ] device-verified (human gate)
- [ ] reviewed
- [ ] docs-closed
- [ ] merged

Proof:
- headless: `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint`, `bun run swift:lint`, `bun run test` from `packages/` all green. `xcodebuild` native compile: BUILD SUCCEEDED. `structure.ios.md` diff = zero changes.
- device: scenario written in `tasks/U3-007/evidence/headless.md`. Requires iOS 17+ device/simulator to verify `.symbolEffect` rendering and symbol→symbol transition. Android degradation confirmed by `select()` test.
- docs: `structure.ios.md` §symbol already pinned — consumed, not re-derived. `24-symbols.md` already ratified. No new ledger row to close (FX-009 resolved by DOC-008).

## Maintenance

- The table is the **view**; the detail block / `tasks/<id>/` folder is the **store**. On disagreement, the store wins — same discipline as "the source doc closes a ledger row, not the ledger."
- A row reaches `ready-to-merge` (complete) only when its `Closes:` rows are true in their source docs. Until then it sits at `docs-pending`, however green the build.
- Escalate by need: row → add a detail block when the task is active → promote to a `tasks/<id>/` folder when it accrues device evidence.
