# Runtime: lifecycle & teardown
Status: researched
Phase: v2 (the owned GPU loop lives on the `expo-view` substrate)
Feeds: 50-api-and-presets.md, 33/34/35 (the content-motion runtime it also governs)
Owns: the lifecycle contract (cross-platform). Mechanics → structure.{ios,android}.

## Why this matters

Two kinds of `expo-view` runtime own **native lifetimes**, so lifecycle is non-optional:
(1) an interactive **shader surface** owns a GPU surface + frame loop, and (2) the **owned
content-motion runtime** (`FxAnimationDriver`/`FxPresenceCoordinator`, `34`/`35`) owns
in-flight animations + coordinator state. Both must **pause off-window and backgrounded**
and tear down **idempotently and leak-free**. (Hosted effects don't own a loop the same way
— SwiftUI/Compose manage it.) This doc owns the cross-platform contract; the Metal/`MTKView`
and the native-animator specifics live in `structure.{ios,android}.md`.

## The owned-resource model

| Resource | Created | Released | Per-frame? |
|---|---|---|---|
| render surface (`MTKView`/equiv) | view init | view dealloc | — |
| device / command queue | once | teardown (or device-shared) | no |
| shader library | once, lazily | teardown | no |
| pipeline state (per shader id) | once, cached | teardown / evict | no |
| uniform storage | once | teardown | reused, not realloc'd |
| drawable + command buffer | every frame | autorelease drain | **yes — never stored** |

## Pause is mandatory

The loop runs **only when `window != nil` AND the app is foreground.** A GPU loop
running off-screen burns battery, and rendering to a drawable while backgrounded is
invalid (stalls/rejections). Two triggers, one switch:

- **Off-window (per-view)** — the attach/detach hook (`didMoveToWindow` /
  `onDetachedFromWindow`) flips the loop.
- **App background/foreground (shared)** — the module's
  `OnAppEntersBackground`/`OnAppEntersForeground` fan out to a **weak registry** of
  live surfaces.

Combine into one `updatePausedState()`. On resume, re-acquire a fresh drawable each
frame — never cache one across the pause.

## Idempotent teardown

Order, most-transient → most-owned, **safe to run twice** (runs from both destroy and
a recycling reset):

1. **Stop the loop first** (pause + drop the delegate / invalidate the display link)
   so no in-flight frame touches a half-freed pipeline.
2. Per-frame transients — nothing to free (autorelease-managed; the rule is *don't
   store them*).
3. Release pipeline cache + library + uniform storage.
4. Release queue, then device, last (or never, if device-shared).

**Retain-cycle discipline:** rely on the weak view delegate; hold the view weakly from
any separate renderer; **always invalidate a `CADisplayLink`** on off-window and
teardown; `[weak self]` in every closure; weak refs in the app-state registry. *If the
destructor never fires, you have one of these cycles.*

## Recycling

Fabric view-recycling is **on by default for general RN views**, but **Expo Modules
views opt out** — `shouldBeRecycled() = false`, so fx's views are **never recycled**
(verified, `33`/`35`). Recycling is therefore **not an active Expo-view hazard**; the
reset rule is **defensive** — it also runs from the idempotent teardown path (it is safe
to run twice) and guards any platform divergence. The contract stands: make
prop-application **fully self-sufficient** (resolve the complete shader+uniform config
from current props, never assume prior state); on rebind **keep** the expensive
identity-stable resources (device/queue/library, and the same-id pipeline) but **reset**
per-bind state (uniforms, animation clock, paused flag). Don't opt into Android
`enableViewRecycling` in V1 — that would *introduce* the hazard fx otherwise avoids.

## The content-motion runtime (same rules, different resources)

The content-motion runtime (`33`–`35`) is no GPU loop, but it owns lifetimes and obeys the
same contract:

- **Pause off-window/backgrounded** — the `FxAnimationDriver`'s native animations
  (`CASpringAnimation` / View animations) pause when `window == nil` or backgrounded, via the
  same `updatePausedState()` triggers; a presence envelope mid-flight *holds*, not burns.
- **Idempotent teardown** — releasing the `FxPresenceCoordinator`/driver stops in-flight
  animations and clears the wrapper handle; safe to run twice.
- **Teardown during exit (the edge, `35`)** — split by whether a JS receiver survives. A
  cancel *while the component still lives* (a `visible` retarget) emits `interrupted:true`.
  But if the view unmounts for a *non-animation* reason **mid-exit** (parent unmounts, app
  teardown), the **JS receiver is gone**, so the coordinator cancels the exit, **releases its
  retained handle** (React unmounts the subtree), and **emits nothing** — no live `FxPresence`
  to hear it. Either way it must **never leak the retained-exiting child**.
- **Recycling** — a recycled content wrapper resets coordinator state (phase, in-flight
  target) from current props — the same self-sufficiency rule as the shader surface.

## Decisions

1. **The interactive surface owns its GPU loop**; pause is **mandatory** — runs only
   when on-window AND foreground, via one `updatePausedState()`.
2. **Persistent objects once, reused** (device/queue/library/pipeline cached);
   per-frame transients never stored.
3. **Idempotent teardown order** (stop loop → release pipeline/library/uniforms →
   release queue/device); safe to run twice.
4. **Retain-cycle discipline** — weak delegate, weak view-from-renderer, invalidate
   display links, `[weak self]`, weak registry.
5. **Recycling: self-sufficient prop application**; keep heavy resources across a
   same-id rebind, reset per-bind state; no Android view-recycling opt-in in V1.
6. **No native flatten opt-out needed** — a custom host view is never layout-only;
   only a JS-side children container that must survive carries `collapsable={false}`.
7. **The content-motion runtime obeys the same lifecycle** — pause off-window/backgrounded,
   idempotent teardown, and a defined teardown-during-exit path (`35`); never leak the
   retained-exiting child.

## Open questions

- **Drawable-on-resume (needs-device)** — confirm fast background↔foreground toggles
  yield a fresh drawable with no stall.
- **One queue per view vs device-shared singleton (needs-device)** — measure churn
  under many simultaneous surfaces.
- **On-demand vs continuous for the press/uniform path** — does one frame per
  touch/`setUniform` feel responsive, or do interactive shaders need a short burst?
- **Expo per-view recycling reset hook** — does the pinned SDK expose a
  `prepareToRecycleView` equivalent to route to the reset? (`53`).
